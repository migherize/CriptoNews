            "Twitter was certainly overwhelmed. The sudden increase in the price of LUNC shows that the community might still entail trust in the asset. This sudden surge could be due to the fact that several were getting back at Kwon by not investing in LUNA 2.0 and sticking to LUNC. ",

            "Layer 2 refers to technologies that allow an application to scale by processing transactions outside of the Ethereum Mainnet (layer 1) while preserving the same security and decentralization as the mainnet. Layer 2 solutions boost transaction speed, or throughput, while at the same time lowering gas costs. Polygon and Polkadot are popular Ethereum layer 2 solutions.",
            "Although the Ethereum blockchain is the most commonly utilized and likely the most secure, it is not without flaws. The Ethereum Mainnet is notorious for its long transaction times (13 per second) and high gas fees. Layer 2s, which are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that transactions are secure, fast, and scalable.",
            "Each system has its own set of advantages and disadvantages to consider, including throughput, gas costs, security, scalability, and, of course, functionality. At the moment, no one layer 2 solution can meet all of these requirements. However, there are layer 2 scaling techniques known as rollups that try to improve all of these qualities.",
            "Layer 2 solutions are significant because they provide scalability and greater throughput while maintaining the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s integrity, allowing for complete decentralization, transparency, and security while lowering carbon emissions. Less gas means less energy is utilized, which means less carbon is produced.\u00a0",
            "Rollups are layer 2 scaling solutions that offload transaction processing off the main Ethereum network while still posting transaction data to layer 1. Because the transaction data is on layer 1, the same layer 1 security requirements apply to rollups. This is, in fact, the distinguishing feature of rollups for users."
